# ArduinoReactionTimeGame
Measures the reaction time

### How To Use
Change, within main.ino, the following definitions:
- #define BS_PIN 7
- #define E_PIN 8
- #define D4_PIN 9
- #define D5_PIN 10
- #define D6_PIN 11
- #define D7_PIN 12

to the pins you're using for the lcd display...
- #define BTN_PIN 13

to the pin you're using for the button input...
- #define R_LED_PIN 6
- #define G_LED_PIN 4
- #define B_LED_PIN 5

to the pins you're using for the RGB (red/green/blue), where R_LED_PIN represents the red pin on the component, for instance.
